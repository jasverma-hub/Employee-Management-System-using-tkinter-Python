# Employee-Management-System-using-tkinter-Python

# Introduction

The "Employee Management System" is a desktop application built with Python and the Tkinter library. The project aims to simplify the process of managing employee data within an organization. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that enables HR personnel or administrators to perform various tasks related to employee management, such as adding new employees, updating their information, and generating reports. The application stores employee data in a local database and ensures secure data management for the organization.

# Project Overview
The objective is to develop an Employee Management System in Python that utilizes a MySQL Database to store the information. The script will include the following operations:
- Add Employee: This operation will allow adding new employees to the database by inserting a new row with their details.
- Remove Employee: A function will be created to delete the record of any existing employee from the Employee table.
- Promote Employee: The system will facilitate making changes to an employee's record, such as promotions, by updating the fetched data from the database.
- Display Employees: Another function will enable viewing information about all existing employees in the database.
The Employee Management System operates by fetching data from the database, applying the necessary changes through the respective functions, and updating the records accordingly. Utilizing a database ensures that the information remains intact even after multiple program sessions, preventing data loss.
